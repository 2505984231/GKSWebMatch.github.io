			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Historical life</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px">Fang Qinhan, born on April 20, 1925 in Lutoufang Village, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, was weak when he was young. His father intended to let him go to the clerk, but the big brother who was studying did not agree, insisting that the younger brother should study, so Fang Qinhan I got the chance to study.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px">? In July 1939, Fang Qinhan graduated from the First Central Primary School of Huangyan County.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> He graduated from Huangyan County High School in February 1946. In July of this year, the Southwest Associated University jointly recruited students in Shanghai. He and his classmates came to Shanghai to participate in the examinations of five universities and finally chose Tsinghua University.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In the autumn of 1946, Fang Qinhan came to Tsinghua University to study civil engineering structure. Tsinghua's academic style is good, teaching is good, equipment is good, and it provides the best learning conditions for the students; there are famous scholars who are his teachers, so that Fang Qinhan admires it, and has set up the ambition of studying hard and serving the motherland. At that time, on the eve of the victory of the Chinese revolution, Fang Qinhan not only studied hard, but also cared about current affairs politics. Under the influence of progressive classmates, he participated in anti-hunger and anti-civil war parade many times and ushered in the birth of new China.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In August 1950, Fang Qinhan graduated with honors and obtained a bachelor's degree and was assigned to the Ministry of Railways. At this time, in order to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first bridge of the Yangtze River, the Design Department of the Ministry of Railways established the Wuhan Bridge Design Group. Fang Qinhan and his classmate Pan Jiyan, together with the lofty aspirations of building a new China, came to the Wuhan Bridge Design Group and have since formed an indissoluble bond with the bridge.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> Fang Qinhan worked for four years under the guidance of design leader Wang Xusen and learned a lot. Wang Xusen's pragmatic and rigorous work style has a great influence on Qin Han and has become an example for Fang Qinhan to be a man.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px">In 1954, after the overall design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed, Fang Qinhan, who was learned from Wang Xusen to learn the steel beam design "truth", was appointed as the design leader of the Hengyang Xiangjiang Bridge on the Xianggui line. This is the first time that Fang Qinhan worked alone. He used what he learned to design the upper bridge structure as a continuous steel truss beam on the upper and lower layers of the highway and railway. The highway approach bridge is a fabricated reinforced concrete structure. This was relatively advanced in the 1950s, and later it was called “Little Wuhan Bridge”.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In 1956, Fang Qinhan presided over the design of the Wujiang Bridge on the Sichuan-Yunnan line and the Baishayu Yangtze River Bridge in Chongqing, and also served as the Sino-Soviet cooperation Fengtai test base.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px">The design of the Wujiang Bridge was designed with the survey team stationed on the edge of the Wujiang River. According to the situation at the time, Fang Qinhan proposed a combination of high-rise piers, steel and reinforced concrete. This was a bold design at the time. In the work of Fengtai Test Base, under the leadership of former Soviet experts, he was the person in charge of the flexible arch of prefabricated prestressed reinforced concrete rigid beams. From theoretical research to on-site implementation, good results have been achieved.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In 1958, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was launched. Fang Qinhan served as the head of the Nanjing Bridge Steel Beam Design Team and worked under the auspices of Wang Xusen. It took 10 years to make a contribution to the construction of Nanjing Bridge and contributed to the National Science and Technology Progress Award. fourteen. In 1975, Fang Qinhan was ordered to preside over the steel beam design and research of the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, which lasted for 20 years. This is the bridge he has devoted the most.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> During the suspension of the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge, Fang Qinhan continued to participate in the research of 15 manganese-vanadium-nitrogen bridge steel, and presided over the design of eight steel beams with distinctive bridges. Mainly: Guangmao Line Beijiang Bridge, its highway bridge part is China's first highway steel box girder bridge; Jingshan Line Yan Canal Bridge, using low-level beam to achieve success in China, won the National Excellent Design Silver Award; Tianjin Ziya River University Hongqiao, with an oblique 45° and a span of 87.5+72.5 meters, is the head of the domestic diagonal bridge; Tianjin Haimen Bridge, the largest span spanning bridge in Asia (64 meters), successfully solved the contradiction between highway opening and sea-rail navigation. The second prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award, Fang Qinhan ranked seventh; Changdong Yellow River Bridge, with a total length of 1,028 meters, won the National Excellent Design Copper Award. It also presided over the steel beam design of Yongding Xinhe Bridge, Qiong County River Bridge, Myanmar Ding Yin, Bei Mao, Mao Bin, Yang Dong and other bridges.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In 1986, the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was re-launched. Fang Qinhan, who had retired from the deputy chief engineer of the Bureau of Survey and Design of the Bridge Bureau, was once again escorted to the design and research of the steel beam of the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge and fulfilled the duties of the deputy chief engineer. After 10 years of hard work and rushing, the construction of the Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge was completed. Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge won the first prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award in 1998, and Fang Qinhan ranked first.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In 1996, Fang Qinhan, who was over the age of the ancients, once again took the lead in the exhibition and served as the person in charge of the design and research of the steel beam of the Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge, and the impact on the new bridge technology peak.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> In 1997, Fang Qinhan was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering with his performance. He was also elected as a model worker of Hubei Province and a representative of the 6th People's Congress of Wuhan. He has won 5 National Science and Technology Progress Awards (1 special prize, 2 first prizes, 1 second and third prizes), 6 ministerial science and technology progress awards and the 3rd Zhan Tianyou Railway Science and Technology Award. Grand prizes and enjoy special government allowances.</p><br>

			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px"> He has published three exchange papers abroad and more than 10 papers published in China. Since joining the work, he has been engaged in the design and research, promotion, research and development of the steel beam of the bridge for a long time, and has innovated a variety of new materials, new structures and new processes, so that the bridge projects designed and built have reached the international advanced level in the same period, in order to realize the railway. The bridge's development goals of “high strength, large span, light weight and overall” have made outstanding contributions. He has won five scientific and technological progress awards and six scientific and technological progress awards of the Ministry of Railways.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px">He was involved in the discussion and revision of the railway bridge and culvert specification of the Ministry of Railways (the steel structure part of the 1959 edition). It was the main writer of the second bridge culvert (steel structure part) of the 1975 edition of the railway engineering technical specification; in the 1980s, he participated in the structural reliability specification of the Ministry of Railways. Prepared as a member of the editorial board and the main drafter; in the 1990s, he edited the bridge steel structure design specification and was the main drafter. In 1987, he was awarded the title of “Model Worker” in Hubei Province. In 1992, he received special government allowance.
