                	<h2 style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;">History of bridge development in China</h2>
					
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;">Looking back at the bridges of old China, the Yangtze River is the Tianzhu, three bridges on the Yellow River: Jinpu Railway Bridge of Jinpu Railway, Zhengzhou Railway Bridge of Jinghan Railway and Huanghe Bridge of Lanzhou City, and some bridges in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. It was not built by foreign merchants.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;">The only thing we can be proud of is the Hangzhou Qiantang River Bridge, which was built by Mr. Mao Yisheng. The bridge was led by a group of international students to design and supervise them. However, the actual construction was still contracted by Danish Kangyi Yangxing for the substructure and caisson foundation engineering, and the upper structural steel beam was contracted for manufacture and installation by Yingshangmen Menlang. Old Chinese contractors have not yet built the capacity of the bridge, and the government transportation department does not have a bridge construction team. It can only do some road bridges and culverts. (At that time, the highest level of Chinese bridge engineering team was pushed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Works led by Mr. Zhao Zukang. Before the liberation, they had designed and built several reinforced concrete cantilever bridges across the Suzhou River, which still play a role. This team is also At the beginning of the liberation, the important technical force of bridge construction in China was later established as the Shanghai Municipal Government Engineering Design Institute.</p><br>

				   	<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">An important symbol of a modern city - the city overpass</h2>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> Since the 1960s, China has been building the original overpass. After the reform and opening up, Guangdong took the lead in building the urban elevated road in 1983 to alleviate the increasingly crowded traffic. In the mid-1980s, the first climax of the nationwide bridge was established.</p><br>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> In the late 1980s, the Shanghai inner ring road was elevated, the north and south elevated roads of Chengdu Road and the east and west elevated roads of Yan'an Road formed the “Shen”-shaped urban elevated road in Shanghai, which greatly improved the traffic in the urban area. Several of the interchanges (Chengxi Road Interchange, Gonghe New Road Interchange, Yan'an West Road Interchange, Longyang Road Interchange and Luoshan Road Interchange have their own characteristics, which initially showcases the modern style of Shanghai's metropolis. In the late 1990s, Shanghai began to link the outer ring line with the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou expressways. At the end of the century, the traffic lines in Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were smoothed.</p><br>

				   	<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Bridge problems - research on earthquake resistance, wind resistance, etc. </h2>
				   	<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> After the Tangshan earthquake in the 1970s, Professor Li Guohao began to study the seismic theory of bridges, the shock absorption and isolation performance of rubber bearings, and the theory and method of nonlinear seismic response analysis of long-span bridges. In the 1980s, Tongji University established an earthquake simulation shaking table. He has undertaken seismic research on more than 20 bridges, including the Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, Shanghai Yangpu Bridge and Guizhou Jiangjie River Bridge. The research level has entered the world first.</p><br>
				   	<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> In the late 1970s, Professor Li Guohao organized research on bridge wind resistance. Since 1979, Tongji University has used the low-speed air tunnel to conduct wind tunnel test on the segmental model of Shanghai Dagang Bridge and other bridges. In 1983, the three-dimensional flutter theory of cable-stayed bridge was studied. In 1985, the full-bridge aeroelastic model wind tunnel test of Shanghai Nanpu Bridge combined with cable-stayed bridge was carried out. In 1990, the wind resistance test and research of Shanghai Nanpu Bridge with a main span of 423 meters was completed. In 1994, a large bridge wind tunnel was built, ranking second in the world. The wind tunnel completed the wind tunnel experiment of the full-bridge aeroelastic model of the Humen Bridge and the Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, marking that the research level of wind-resistant bridges in China has entered the world's advanced ranks.</p><br>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> China is planning major bridge projects in the early 21st century, such as the Changjiangkou Sutong Bridge Project, the Pearl River Estuary Ocean Project, the Qiongzhou Strait Project and the Zhoushan Islands Liandao Project. It will surely push the study of earthquake resistance and wind resistance of our bridges to a higher level.</p><br>

				   	<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">The dream of bridge in the era of knowledge economy </h2>
					<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">? The bridge project in the era of knowledge economy will have the following characteristics:</h4>
				   	<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 15px;"> First, in the planning and design phase, using computer-aided means for effective and rapid optimization and simulation analysis, the application of Virtual Reality technology can anticipate the appearance and function of the bridge, simulate the performance of earthquakes and typhoons, etc.</p><br>
				   	<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 15px;"> Secondly, in the manufacturing and erection phase, the intelligent manufacturing system is used to process the factory, and then the global positioning system and remote control technology are used to manage and control the construction of the bridge at the headquarters.</p><br>
				   	<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 15px;"> Finally, after operation, ensure the safety and normal operation of the bridge through automatic monitoring and management systems. In the event of a malfunction or injury, the health diagnostics and expert system will report the injury site and maintenance measures.</p><br>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 15px;"> Looking back at the achievements of the bridge project in the 20th century, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan was recorded in the history of the bridge with a record of 1991 meters and a depth of 50 meters. We have probably built a 4,000-meter-long bridge in the 21st century. If the new carbon fiber materials are mature, there is hope to break through the 5000-meter mark in the 21st century. At the same time, if it can solve the new basic technology of 50~100 meters water depth, it will obtain a more economical and reasonable channel engineering plan, and realize the common goals and dreams of the land transportation network on four continents.</p><br>
