                	<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Detailed introduction</h2>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">Located between Xiaguan in Gulou District of Nanjing and Qiaobei in Pukou District, Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the first double-deck railway and highway bridge designed and built by China on the Yangtze River. It has a history of bridges and bridges in China. The important significance is an important achievement of China's economic construction and an important milestone in the construction of China's bridges. It has great economic, political and strategic significance and is known as the “bridge of competition”. It is not only a symbol of technological achievements and modernization in New China, but also carries the special emotions and memories of generations in China.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a key node for traffic in the eastern part of China. The upper level is a highway bridge with a length of 4,589 meters. The roadway is 15 meters wide. It can accommodate four large vehicles in parallel. Each side has a sidewalk of more than 2 meters wide and connects to the 104 national highway. The 312 National Highway and other cross-river highways are one of the main routes connecting Nanjing Jiangbei New District and Jiangnan Main City; the lower level is a two-track double-track railway bridge with a width of 14 meters and a total length of 6772 meters. It connects the Jinpu Railway and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Transportation and lifeline. The bridge consists of two parts: the main bridge and the approach bridge. The main bridge has 9 piers and 10 spans, with a length of 1576 meters and a maximum span of 160 meters. The navigation clearance width is 120 meters, and the clearance height under the bridge is 24 meters above the designed maximum navigation water level, which can pass the 5,000-ton sea-going.</p><br>
				    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Yangtze River Bridge is the landmark building of Nanjing, the cultural symbol of Jiangsu, the glory of China, and a famous attraction. It is listed as the forty-eight scenes of the new Jinling. From 1970 to 1993, it has hosted heads of state, government, and more than 600 foreign delegations from more than 100 countries and regions. It is hard to count the domestic and foreign tourists who come here to visit. The construction of the bridge lasted for 8 years, costing 287.58 million yuan, using 384,100 cubic meters of concrete and 66,500 tons of steel. In 1960, it was included in the Guinness Book of World Records in the world's longest railway bridge. In July 2014, it was selected as an immovable cultural relic. In September 2016, it was selected into the first batch of China's 20th century architectural heritage.</p>

                				<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">building structure</h2>
                				<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a special bridge for railway and highway use. The length of the railway bridge is 6772 meters, and the length of the highway bridge is 4589 meters. The bridge can pass 10,000 tons of ships. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the third bridge across the Yangtze River after the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the Chongqing Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge. It is also the largest of the three bridges. The bridge and railway bridge will officially connect the Jinpu and Shanghai-Nanjing railway lines, and direct access to Shanghai from Beijing. Since then, the Beijing-Shanghai railway has been blocked by the Yangtze River. The positive bridge on the river surface is 1577 meters long, and the rest is the approach bridge. It is the most bridge in China.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Design Parameters</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The railway approach bridge designed by Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is taken from the North Shore Forest Farm Station, and the south bank is connected by the Sunjiatun to Nanjing Station. The distance is 22 kilometers. The railway bridge deck is double line and 14 meters wide. Long lines are laid on the lines for seamless lines. The rail is 50 kg/m, the slope of the line is 4 ‰, and the minimum curve radius is 1200 m. The road deck has a net width of 15 meters and is 4 lanes. There are clear sides of 2.25 meters on both sides. The maximum slope of the highway deck is 3.17‰, and the minimum curve radius is 250m. The length of the whole bridge, the railway part is 6772 meters, the highway part is 4588 meters, and the river face is 1576 meters long. The highest navigable water level is +8.27 meters, and the clearance under the bridge is 24×120 meters, which can be used for navigation below 5,000 tons. The bridge is loaded with weight, the railway is at the middle level -24, and the highway is at the steam level -18. After the completion of the main bridge and the approach bridge, the South Bank built a branch road bridge (also known as Huilong Bridge), which is 409 meters long. Road decks and ground vehicles can be moved up and down.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Construction environment</h2>
								<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">● Geological complexity</h4>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Yangtze River in the Nanjing section generally refers to the section from the Caishiji of Ma'anshan in Anhui to the Zhenjiang of Jiangsu. The terrain here is like a dudou. The water is deep and urgency. The river width is more than 1500 meters on average, and the narrowest part is also 1100 meters. The water depth is more than 15 to 30 meters, the deepest is more than 70 meters, and the flow rate is 3 meters per second. The dangerous terrain has formed the "Yangtze River".</p><br>
								<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">● Hongxun disaster</h4>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">In September 1964, the bridge project encountered the biggest crisis in construction: under the impact of the autumn flood, the anchor ropes of the suspended cavities of No. 5 and No. 4 piers collapsed successively, and the sinking wells with a weight of more than 6,000 tons were the largest in the rapids. With a periodic swing of 60 meters, the bridge faces the great danger of overturning the sinking shaft and scrapping the bridge site. The bridge-building workers risked their lives in the floods and continued to rescue for nearly two months. In the end, Lin Yinyue’s “balanced heavy-duty swinging” scheme was used to overcome the swing of the caisson and turn the bridge into safety.</p><br>
								<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">● Economic difficulties</h4>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">Soon after the bridge started, China faced three difficult times and a large number of projects were dismantled. The bridge project was required to streamline new workers and the funds were reduced to no more than 30 million yuan per year, only enough to maintain daily expenses. After investigation and reporting by the Ministry of Railways Peng Min and the leaders of Jiangsu Province Jiang Yanqing and Hui Yuyu, Premier Zhou Enlai approved the bridge as a special case to continue recruiting and purchasing equipment. The Nanjing Municipal Government guaranteeed the supply of living materials and construction continued.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Value meaning</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 13px;">The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the first railway and highway bridge built and built by China based on its own strength. It is designed and built by China itself. It was the largest railway and highway bridge in China at that time. It has become the main artery of communication between the north and the south, marking the construction of China's bridges to the world's advanced level. Its completion has created a new era of China's "self-reliance" building of large-scale bridges, and is regarded as a "model of self-reliance" and "a great achievement of socialist construction", called "the bridge of competition."</p><br>
