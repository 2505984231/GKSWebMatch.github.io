												<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The new-generation military large-scale transport aircraft researched and manufactured by China was mainly designed by the First Aircraft Design and Research Institute of China Aviation Industry Corporation and Xi'an Aircraft Industry Group (referred to as: Xifei). It was successfully launched on January 26, 2013.As a large-scale multi-purpose transport aircraft, the aircraft can perform long-distance air transport tasks of various materials and personnel under complex meteorological conditions. Compared with the current Air Force's current Il-76, the engine and electronic equipment of the Yun-20 have been greatly improved, the load capacity has also been improved, and the short runway has excellent landing and landing performance. The research and development of the Yun-20 aircraft refers to the aerodynamic shape and structural design of the Russian Il-76, incorporating some features of the US C-17. Yun-20 adopts the conventional layout, the cantilever upper wing, the leading edge swept, the wingless winglet, the maximum takeoff weight is 220 tons, the load is over 66 tons, the maximum speed is °›800 kilometers, and the range is more than 7800 kilometers. Limited to 13,000 meters. Highly scalable, highly reliable and safe. As a large-scale multi-purpose transport aircraft, Yun-20 can carry out long-distance air transport tasks of various materials and personnel under complex meteorological conditions. On November 10, 2017, the Air Force spokesperson said that after the ºﬂ-20 and -20 install troops, formation training has been carried out. At the 12th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, the third appearance of the Yun-20 transport aircraft, which was widely watched by the outside world, was exhibited at the air show, and the "S" type maneuver, the sharply rising turn and the small route and the fast landing were displayed.</p>

																<p><span style="font-weight: 900;color: #000000;">Pneumatic layout</span>&nbsp &nbsp
																	&nbspThe Yun-20 adopts the conventional layout. The wing is a cantilevered upper wing. The main wing has a large aspect ratio and a medium swept wing. The leading edge sweep angle of the wing is constant (the 1/4 string sweep angle is about 24~). Around 26 degrees), the trailing edge of the wing adopts two types of swept-back mode - the trailing edge sweep angle of the middle and outer wing sections is larger, and the sweep angle of the inner wing section of the wing is significantly reduced, and there is no winglet winglet. Cantilevered T-tail. There is a small dorsal fin forward at the joint between the vertical stabilizer and the fuselage.</p>

																<p><span style="font-weight: 900;color: #000000;">Body structure</span>&nbsp &nbsp
																	&nbspThe Yun-20 uses supercritical wings and increases the proportion of composite materials used, which can reduce the structural weight of the aircraft. As the lift of the aircraft increases, the lift-to-drag ratio increases, so even if the engine thrust and the maximum take-off weight remain the same, the load will increase. The Il-76 uses a critical wing with a low carry/takeoff weight ratio.</p>

																	&nbspYun-20 adopts domestic integrated avionics system, with ARINC429 bus as the backbone, connects electronic flight instruments, flight control, navigation, communication, meteorological and engine data and instructions to achieve comprehensive data processing and color display in the cockpit. The screen is displayed. In addition, self-defense interference systems may be added, including missile approach warning systems, interference transmitters, and racks.</p>
