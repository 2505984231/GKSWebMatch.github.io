                	<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Detailed introduction</h2>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is a bridge and tunnel project connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao in China. It is located in the Boyang area of Guangdong Province, China, and is the southern section of the Ring Expressway in the Pearl River Delta region.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was started on December 15, 2009. On July 7, 2017, the main project of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was completed. On February 6, 2018, the main body of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was completed and accepted, on September 28 of the same year.From the beginning of the day, the joint trial operation of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao will be carried out.</p><br>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge starts from the Hong Kong Port artificial island near the Hong Kong International Airport. It connects the Zhuhai and Macao artificial islands westward across the Bohai Sea and ends at Zhuhai Hongwan. The total length of the bridge and tunnel is 55 kilometers, of which the main bridge is 29.6.The distance from the port of Hong Kong to the Zhuhai-Macao port is 41.6 kilometers; the bridge deck is a two-way six-lane expressway with a design speed of 100 km/h; the total investment of the project is 126.9 billion yuan.</p><br>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">On October 23, 2018, the opening ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was held in Zhuhai, Guangdong.Xi Jinping attended the ceremony and announced the official opening of the bridge.On October 24, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was officially opened to traffic.Since December 1, 2018, the first batch of non-operating cars in Guangdong and Macao can be exempted from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.</p>

                				<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">overall arrangement</h2>
                				<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge consists of three navigation bridges, a subsea tunnel, four artificial islands and connecting bridge tunnels, a non-compassing continuous beam bridge in deep and shallow waters, and a landline connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macao.Among them, the three navigation bridges are Qingzhou Waterway Bridge, Jianghai Direct Ship Channel Bridge and Jiuzhou Island Waterway Bridge from east to west; the submarine tunnel is located between Lantau Island and Qingzhou Waterway Bridge in Hong Kong, and connects other bridge sections through east and west artificial islands;The non-navigable continuous beam bridges in the shallow and shallow water areas are located in the near Hong Kong waters and near the Zhuhai waters; the three ports and their artificial islands are located near the approach bridges; the main roads are connected by connecting lines.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">architectural design</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">The main bridge of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is three large-span steel-stayed cable-stayed bridges, each of which has a unique design concept. Among them, the Qingzhou Waterway Bridge Tower's top knot supports the “Chinese knot” cultural element, and “curve” the original right angle and straight line shape, making the bridge tower smart, delicate and elegant. The main tower tower shape of the Jianghai Direct Ship Channel Bridge is taken from the “White Dolphin” element and combined with the marine culture of the Dolphin Reserve. The main tower of Jiuzhou Waterway Bridge is taken from the "sail", which means "sailing and sailing", and it has a serialized effect with the river and the direct navigation of the ship's navigation channel. The overall design of the pylon is strong, with strong affinity, and has a strong landmark. The east and west artificial islands take the "mussel" element, which means that the Qinhai Hengqin Island is rich in mussels. The overall design of the Hong Kong port is innovative, aesthetically pleasing and energy efficient. The inspection building has a wavy canopy design. In order to support the canopy, the pillars of the inspection building are tree-shaped, with a conical shape at the bottom and a branch-like expansion at the top. The toll station closest to Zhuhai City is designed in a curved shape with a steel column in front and several steel cables behind it, like a huge anchor. The height difference between the water and the underwater part of the bridge is nearly 100 meters. It has both a horizontal curve and a vertical height. The whole is as thin and light as a ribbon, and the multiple nodes are strung together, meaning “beads and joints”.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Key projects</h2>
								<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">● Offshore island</h4><br>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;">There are no natural islands in the area where the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge submarine tunnel is located. It is necessary to build an island.Affected by 8 million tons of seabed silt, the construction team adopted the “steel tube island” scheme: pre-manufacturing 120 giant circular steel cylinders with a diameter of 22.5 meters, a height of 55 meters and a weight of 550 tons on the land.It is fixed directly on the seabed, and then the island is filled in the middle of the steel cylinder.This method of construction can avoid the transitional excavation of silt and prevent the riprap or caisson from sliding in the silt.The building on the island adopts a new type of fair-faced concrete with smooth surface, uniform color, sharp edges and corners, no damage and pollution. It is cast once and has no external decoration during construction. It can effectively cope with the unfavorable environment of high sea pressure, high salt and high humidity in the open sea.</p><br>

								<h4 style="font-size: 18px;">● Immersed pipe docking</h4><br>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;line-height: 30px;">The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge immersed tunnel and its technology are the core of the whole project. It not only reduces the length of the bridge and the artificial island, but also reduces the water blocking rate of the building, thus keeping the navigation channel clear and avoiding conflicts with nearby routes.</p><br>

							<div class="text">
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;line-height: 30px;"> Immersed tube technology, that is, shallowly excavating the groove on the seabed, then placing the prefabricated tunnel into the groove and then docking underwater.The immersed tube tunnel adopts an unmanned docking immersed tube system integrating digital integrated control, numerical control pull, precise sonar measurement and control, remote sensing ballast, etc.; the immersed pipe docking adopts multiple large giant wheels, various technical means and artificial underwater operation.During the underwater immersed pipe docking process, the designers proposed a “composite foundation” scheme, which preserved the gravel cushion setting and moved the compacted sand pile scheme used under the island wall to the tunnel to form a “composite foundation”.To avoid the risk of large-area settlement of tunnels that may occur in the original foundation tank foundation construction scheme.The builders laid 2 to 3 meters of stone on the bottom of the sea and flattened it. The settlement value of the original immersed pipe to pass through various layers with different characteristics should be controlled within 10 cm to avoid uneven settlement of the entire tunnel.</p><br>

								<h2 style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;">Scientific research results</h2><br>
								<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 13px;line-height: 30px;">More than 300 research projects have been carried out before and after the construction of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. More than 500 papers have been published (including 235 scientific papers), 18 monographs have been published, 30 standards and guidelines have been compiled, and 11 software copyrights have been published. More than 1,000 innovative projects have been completed.More than 40 construction methods were created, forming 63 technical standards and creating more than 600 patents (53 domestic patents granted in China); successively conquering more than ten worlds such as artificial island rapid island formation, deep buried immersed tube structure design, tunnel composite foundation, etc.Level technical difficulties, drive the construction of 20 bases and production lines, form the core technology with China's independent intellectual property rights, and establish an industrialized technical system for China's cross-sea channel construction.。</p>
