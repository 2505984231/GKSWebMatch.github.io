					<h2 style="line-height: 50px;font-size: 18px;">Biography</h2>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">● Fan Lichu, born in 1933, Zhenhai, Zhejiang, graduated from the Department of Bridge and Tunnel Engineering of Tongji University in July 1955. He is currently a professor at the School of Civil Engineering of Tongji University, a doctoral tutor, and the deputy director of the State Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Disaster Prevention. The country has outstanding contributions to experts. He used to be the dean of the School of Structural Engineering of Tongji University. He is currently the chairman of the International Association of International Bridges (IABSE), the alternate member of the Standing Committee of the International Association of Bridges and Structural Engineering, a member of the EASEC International Steering and Executive Committee, and the executive director of the China Civil Engineering Society. , Chairman of the Bridge and Structural Engineering Branch of the China Civil Engineering Society. In 2001, he was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.</p><br>

			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Personal deeds</h3>
			<h4 style="font-size: 18px;font-size: 16px;">1、 Research topic</h4><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In the early 1980s, China began to build large-scale prestressed concrete T-structures and continuous beam bridges. Academician Fan Lichu timely collected the experience of design and construction at home and abroad, and summarized his research results. In 1988, he wrote the prestressed concrete continuous beam, which was highly evaluated in the bridge industry after publication and included in the excellent books. </p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;">After the Tangshan earthquake, under the leadership of Academician Li Guohao, a research group on seismic theory of bridges was established. He studied the seismic theory of bridges and compiled the nonlinear seismic response analysis program for bridge planes for the first time. Leading the research on the design theory of rubber bearing isolation and isolation, and theoretically analyzing the reasonable value of the comprehensive influence coefficient of the structure in the specification, which was adopted by the 1989 edition of the Seismic Code for Highway Engineering. After 1990, it is urgent to establish a seismic design method for long-span bridges. For the first time, two-level fortification and two-stage design criteria are proposed. The theory and calculation method for spatial nonlinear seismic response analysis of long-span bridges are first established, and software is developed at Shanghai Nanpu Bridge. It has been applied in the research on seismic performance of nearly 30 large-span cable-stayed bridges, suspension bridges, continuous rigid frame and arch bridges, such as the Donghai Bridge, and has been highly praised and praised by experts at home and abroad. In the seismic study of Shanghai Yangpu Bridge, the impact on the seismic force of the anchor pier was put forward in time, and the design was improved by the principle of impact reduction and isolation. The correctness of this conclusion was destroyed by the anchor pier support of the cable-stayed bridge in the Kobe earthquake in Japan in 1995. As confirmed by the earthquake damage. Combined with the seismic research results of major projects, a seismic guide for suspension bridges was prepared.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> After the 1990s, China's urban elevated and complex interchange projects are increasing. According to the earthquake damage lessons of the United States and Japan in the past 20 years, the first complex complex interchange space seismic design method (in the past, separated into independent viaducts for seismic analysis) It is applied to the seismic design of the three-story single-column overpass in Chengdu Road, Shanghai, and the seismic assessment of the largest Yanzhuang interchange in Asia. The first and second generation of rubber anti-vibration bearings and cushioning blocks have been patented by the state. Currently, large-scale high-damping rubber anti-seismic bearings are being studied. Anti-seismic bearings and cushioning blocks have been used in Shantou Bay Second Bridge and Tianjin New Yongding Bridge. Applied in the project. In 1998, theoretical and pseudo-dynamic tests were carried out on the seismic performance of a double-deck elevated system in which Shanghai's urban elevated roads and metro rail transit were built. For the first time, the three-level design criteria for three-level fortification was introduced in the seismic design of bridges. The unit calculation model of the track system was developed. The criteria for ductile seismic design and capacity protection were applied, and the seismic design guidelines for double-story viaducts were prepared.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> After 20 years of systematic and long-term research on bridge seismic research, we have obtained a full theoretical reserve for a series of scientific research results. Based on the two guides, in early 2001, we compiled the first request for the “Code for Seismic Design of Urban Bridges”. Draft opinion, the third draft was completed in 2003. It will be the most widely used seismic design specification for bridges at home and abroad. It will introduce the three-level design and performance-based criteria for the first time, emphasizing structural dynamic concept design, increasing the design of ductile seismic design and seismic isolation design, and strengthening structural measures. It can be applied to the seismic design of girder bridges, elevated and overpasses, arch bridges, cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Academician Fan Lichu received rich theoretical and applied results in the systematic and continuous work in the field of seismic protection of bridges. He led the members of the subject group to write "Bridge Seismic" and won the first prize of excellent textbooks in East China Universities. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the new norms, the "Bridge Seismic Theory and Application Series" (a set of four volumes) was specially written and published in early 2002. Received (hosted or participated in) provincial and ministerial-level scientific and technological progress special prizes, first prizes, and second prizes.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Since 1992, he has chaired the National Natural Science Foundation's “Eighth Five-Year Plan” key project “Research on Vibration Control of Building Structures for Earthquake Resistance and Wind Resistance”. In 1993, he undertook the National C Project B research project “Major water conservancy and civil engineering safety and durability. The establishment of the standard basic research "long-span cable-stayed bridge, suspension bridge engineering control and basic research on the reliability and durability of large bridge structures. In 1998, the National Natural Science Foundation of China was responsible for the key scientific issues and design of large-scale complex systems. Sub-topic of "The Theory of Large-Span Bridge Structure and Wind and Seismic Research" in the Theory.</p><br>
			<h4 style="font-size: 18px;font-size: 16px;">2、Rainbow spine</h4><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> During the life of the bridge, the probability of destructive earthquakes is very small, requiring all components of the structure to withstand extreme earthquakes without damage, which is neither economical nor realistic. After in-depth research, Academician Fan Lichu proposed a seismic design method for long-span bridges based on lifetime and performance. With as little investment as possible, the bridges can be repaired without shocks, the medium earthquakes can be repaired, and the small earthquakes are not bad. The key technical problems to ensure the seismic safety of the bridge. Nowadays, the "key technology for seismic design of long-span high-rise bridges" has been embodied in the national industry standard "Code for Seismic Design of Highway Bridges" and has been successfully applied to the seismic design of many world-class bridges. According to statistics, there are 23 large-span bridges over 400 meters in China, 16 of which have adopted the results of the Fan Lichu team. He is therefore known as the "ridge of the rainbow."</p><br>
			<h4 style="font-size: 18px;font-size: 16px;">3、Major project</h4><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> On May 12, 2008, the sudden Wenchuan earthquake killed tens of thousands of compatriots, and many bridges collapsed instantaneously. The technical achievements of the Fan Lichu team applied to more than 30 bridges on the Sichuan Yalong Expressway were intact. As a bridge seismic expert, Fan Lichu has participated in relevant seminars and lectures for many times, and offered advice and suggestions for post-disaster reconstruction work, and popularized scientific knowledge to the public. Fan Lichu believes that there are few stations for strong earthquake recording in China, and it is necessary to install strong earthquake instruments and anemometers on major engineering buildings to record and observe relevant data during the earthquake. However, because the price of the strong earthquake meter is less than 100,000 yuan, it is relatively expensive. Fan Lichu suggested that it be forced to install in the new high-rise building in the earthquake zone, and the cost will be borne by the developer.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In response to the situation of many people who judged the quality of their buildings after the earthquake, Fan Lichu called for China to introduce an "engineering forensic" system to comprehensively determine the cause of building damage through various means of detection. He said that the cause of the collapse of the building during the earthquake involves not only the factors of the earthquake itself, but also the rigorous and detailed evaluation from the aspects of architectural design, drawing and construction. Fan Lichu hopes that “Engineering Forensic Medicine” will carry out comprehensive and detailed “physical examination” on the buildings in the disaster areas, provide scientific basis for the formation of building standards for strong earthquake areas applicable to China, and implement accountability system for architectural design and construction units. When returning from Beijing, when the reporter congratulated Fan Lichu, he said with a strong heart: "Compared with the prize, I hope that the awareness of earthquake prevention is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. An earthquake disaster may have destroyed the construction for decades!" It is also revealed that with the support of the second phase of the national “985” platform, a world-first four-line shaker is being built at Tongji University's Jiading campus, where the world's most advanced seismic simulation test can be completed.</p><br>
			<h4 style="font-size: 18px;font-size: 16px;">4、May be a bridge</h4><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Academician Fan said poetically: "The bridge is the messenger and helper of human development. The development of no bridge is difficult. There have been many cities in history. Because there is no bridge and the water transport is weak, it is gradually declining. The bridge connects the city to the city. Let the information and information meet." "I want to be a bridge, I am a bridge." Fan Li, the academician of the teacher Li Guohao, still remembers, "Without Li Guohao, there is no me today, so I want to be like him." Become a bridge and let more students grow on their shoulders.” “It’s a bridge with a selfless mind.” Fan Lichu said, “Teachers should have no teaching.” Fan Lichu always adheres to this in his long teaching career. creed. He believes that teaching and educating people can't teach at the worst level. In this way, good students can't learn anything; the standard of talent division should be diversified, not to ask everyone to become an elite, but everyone should pass Education becomes a person with sound personality.</p><br>

			<div class="text">
			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Character honor</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Comrade Li Guohao loves the motherland and has a firm political position. As early as the 1940s, he had enjoyed a reputation in the international bridge academic community, resolutely declined the mentor's retention and returned to the motherland from Germany. On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, he protected a group of progressive students in patriotism. During the "Cultural Revolution", despite his severe persecution, he was still concentrating on the science and education of the motherland and devoted himself to academic research. After the reform and opening up, he firmly supported the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. With great enthusiasm for work, he paid full attention to science and technology and education. Showing the noble sentiments of a party's senior cadres and senior intellectuals.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Comrade Li Guohao has broadly united all forces and actively promoted the development of the cause of the CPPCC. During his tenure as the chairman of the Sixth CPPCC in Shanghai, he earnestly implemented the Party Central Committee's united front policy and intellectual policy, and gave full play to the role of the CPPCC “talent pool” and “think tank” to contribute to the development of Shanghai's economic construction and social undertakings. With a noble scholarly style and personality, he actively promotes international science and technology, education and cultural exchanges.</p><br>
