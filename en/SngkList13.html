					<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;margin-bottom: 25px;">5G accelerates landing Shenzhen Port is expected to welcome huge changes</h3>
					
					<div class="text" style="width: 100%;margin: 0 auto;">
					
						<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px;">Less than one month from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a 5G license, China Merchants Group 5G Smart Port Innovation Lab was officially unveiled in Shenzhen recently, marking the full launch of 5G smart port construction. Eleven high-tech enterprises including China Merchants Port Group, China Mobile Shenzhen Branch and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. fully participated in the innovation laboratory research. In the future, the transformation of the Haixing Container Terminal in the western port area of Shenzhen will take the opportunity to utilize the scene of the Starfish Terminal. Set up a 5G technology innovation platform, incubate and cultivate a batch of 5G technology applications.</p>

									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px;">According to industry insiders, China Merchants Group's 5G Wisdom Port is the pilot field for domestic 5G services in port applications, and will become the benchmark for port construction in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and will provide more reference for the development of the port industry.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 15px;">Starfish container terminal into business test field</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px; ">The newly-built innovation laboratory is located in the Shenzhen Haixing Container Terminal which is being upgraded. Since the start of construction in September 2017, the Haixing Wisdom Port Project with a total investment of 4.37 billion yuan has designed a 850-meter 200,000-ton container coastline and a rear 400,000-square-meter supporting land facility with a designed annual throughput of 1.55 million TEU. The pilot operation will start in 2020. The first batch of 5G construction sites of the terminal was opened on May 10 this year, and 8 to 10 base stations will be opened in the future to achieve the overall coverage of the port area. After the completion of the entire terminal, it will be upgraded into a world-class “Smart Harbor” with highly automated and intelligent operation management through the combination of high-tech technologies such as unmanned trucks, real-time inspection drones, and smart security for 5G applications. ", leading the industry's new standards.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Li Yubin, deputy general manager of China Merchants Port Group, described the six characteristics of the future China Merchants Smart Port: First, comprehensive perception. Field devices, facilities, and operational data are fully digitized using sensors, real-time transmission through the Internet of Things/wireless network, and data integration for full awareness. The second is extensive interconnection. Through cloud computing and mobile Internet technologies, port stakeholders can use multiple terminals to optimize integration at any time. The third is highly shared. The waste of resources caused by information asymmetry is solved through the sharing of data information, facilities and equipment, and transportation tools. The fourth is self-loading. According to the assigned work tasks, the equipment self-identifies the work object and the work purpose, and completes the loading and unloading task efficiently and safely. The fifth is all-round visibility, which makes the macroscopic situation and local details of the terminal production operations unobstructed. Sixth is intelligent decision-making, based on comprehensive perception and job information, providing intelligent decision support for optimizing production and operation.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Deng Renjie, deputy general manager of China Merchants Group, revealed that China Merchants Port will introduce innovative investment funds, take the transformation of Haixing Container Terminal as an opportunity, use the terminal scene to build a 5G technology innovation platform, and explore 5G technology in the port industry and global with partners. The application of the supply chain provides a demonstration for the port industry. He said that in the future, it will promote the promotion and application of 5G smart port related technologies and achievements in domestic and global ports, and empower the global supply chain.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold; margin-bottom: 15px;">Benchmarking companies jointly research industry application standards</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px; ">The reporter noted that at the unveiling scene, in addition to China Merchants Port Group, China Mobile Shenzhen Branch, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industry Smart Industry Group, Sany Ocean Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., Shanghai ABB Engineering Co., Ltd., Beijing Eight innovative laboratories including Mainline Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai Xijing Information Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen CIMC Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. and Shenzhen Zhongke Tianbang Information Technology Co., Ltd. also signed The laboratory jointly built a declaration, indicating that it will bring together all technical forces to jointly build the first 5G smart port in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px;;">According to industry insiders, the 5G Smart Port Innovation Lab is not only a technical laboratory, but also an industrial gathering place. On the one hand, the Innovation Lab is a 5G technology innovation platform. The 5G technology benchmarking enterprises gather here to participate in the construction, jointly study the industry application technology standards and explore the infinite possibilities of 5G technology. On the other hand, the innovation laboratory is the industrial innovation center. 5G technology, automatic driving technology, AI, dock crane remote control technology and other integrated applications in the port, it is bound to collide with the industrial spark, helping Shenzhen to build the 5G international technology industry innovation center in Dawan District.</p>
									<p style="text-indent: 2em; font-size:18px; margin-bottom: 15px;">And 5G has also become the global technology cusp and industry commanding heights, and the future application scenarios will be more diverse.
