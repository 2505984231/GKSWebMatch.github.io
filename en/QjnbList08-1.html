			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Major achievements</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In the history of the development of Tongji University in the past 100 years, Li Guohao played the most long-term and profound role. Li Guohao has played an irreplaceable role in the construction and development of Tongji University, especially the bridge engineering discipline that he specialized in, which has reached the domestic leading level and has a significant international impact. He advocated and personally organized the implementation of the “two transformations” of Tongji University, leading the school to change the tradition of German-German connection and German teaching, from a single-disciplinary university dominated by civil engineering to a multi-disciplinary university dominated by science and technology. The strategic concept of "two transformations" laid a solid foundation for the establishment of Tongji University's comprehensive and international construction pattern. He reviewed the situation and proposed to build two centers of teaching and research, organized a large number of scientific and technical personnel in the school to embark on the front line of economic construction, promoted the practical integration of teaching, scientific research and economic construction, and practiced the work, participated in the construction planning of Shanghai Huangpu River Bridge and Baosteel. Construction argumentation and other work. In order to realize the concept of a comprehensive university and resume medical science, he personally visited home and abroad, extensively contacted alumni, and recommended outstanding talents. In the meantime, the school has experienced many major events, including the democratically elected principal, the “211 Project”, the “985 Project”, and the two schools. At each critical moment of development, Li Guohao always proposes constructiveness with rich experience in running schools and leadership. Opinions, and visit the scene, to express their insights, so that the whole school has doubled confidence.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> As a famous scientist, Li Guohao's achievements in structural mechanics and bridge engineering are universally recognized. He insisted that the research topic “must have an engineering background, must solve practical problems”, advocated solving high-level theoretical research to solve cutting-edge problems, emphasized the development of theory in practice, and obtained the practical calculation method of suspension bridge according to second-order theory. "Using geometric methods to find the influence line of rigid structures", "New method for structural analysis of trusses and similar systems", "Bending theory of oblique anisotropic plates and its application to inclined bridges", "Twist beam torsion theory - 桁 beam "Torque, stability and vibration of bridge piers", "Calculation of lateral distribution of road bridge loads", "Analysis of horizontal displacement, internal force and bearing capacity of piles", etc., and a series of theoretically groundbreaking and practical application-oriented major achievements The sway of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and the stability of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge created new disciplines such as wind resistance, earthquake resistance and anti-explosion dynamics of bridges. He proposed the bridge construction plan for the large-span laminated girder cable-stayed bridge for the first time in China. The independent design and construction of the Shanghai Nanpu Bridge and the Guangdong Humen Pearl River Bridge were realized and won the opportunity for the Chinese bridge to catch up with the world's advanced level. The chief hero and academic pioneer of the independent construction of large-span bridges. He presided over the formulation of the pre-feasibility study of the Hangzhou Bay traffic passage and the transportation plan across the Yangtze River estuary, which directly contributed to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge and the Sutong Yangtze River Bridge.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> As an outstanding educator, in the teaching career of nearly 70 years, Li Guohao devote himself to teaching and educating people, and he is tireless in carrying the younger generations. Many of his students have become leaders in the field of bridges and structures in China, and many have been elected academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Li Guohao has personal feelings and unique insights on how to promote students to grow up better, and gives specific attention. He advocates the undergraduate students in the lower grades to downplay the profession, try to let students from different disciplines, especially new students, live together, broaden the knowledge, promote the intersection of disciplines, and cultivate the sense of innovation; he advocates that the topic of graduate thesis should not be given by the tutor, but It is up to the students to envisage two or three directions, to present their own opinions, and then to make comments by the instructor, and then to decide by themselves.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> As a remarkable social activist, Li Guohao has served in many leadership positions and social work in addition to busy teaching and research work, and has devoted a lot of efforts to national development and social progress. In his later years, he and other scientists, together with other scientists, proposed and demonstrated the feasibility and importance of building a deep-water port of the Ocean Mountain, and finally implemented it smoothly, becoming an important foundation for Shanghai to build an international shipping center. The "Friends of the CPPCC", which he founded on the chairmanship of the Shanghai CPPCC, set a good example for how the CPPCC organizations at all levels at the time could better play the residual heat of the old comrades.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Li Guohao was elected as one of the world's top ten structural engineers in 1981, and thus entered the ranks of world-class masters in this field. In 1987, he won the International Bridge and Structural Engineering Association Merit Award. He won the Heliang Heli Science and Technology Progress Award in 1995 and 1996, and received the Chen Jiageng Technology Science Award in 1996. He also received the Goethe Medal (1982) and the Federal Grand Cross (1987) from the German government, and the honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Darmstadt (1985) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (1998). In 1977, he was awarded the title of Advanced Worker of the Shanghai Education Front. In 2003, he was awarded the title of the first Shanghai Education Minister. The monograph "Bridge torsion theory, Yanliang bridge torsion, stability and vibration" has won the third prize of the National Natural Science Award in 1982, the National Science Conference Award in 1978, and the major scientific and technological achievements award in Shanghai in 1977. He won the second prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award in 1987 and the first prize of Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Award in 1986; "China Transportation Development Strategy and Policy Research" won the third prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award in 1993; "Calculation of Horizontal Distribution of Highway Bridge Load" won Shanghai The city's major scientific and technological achievements award; "bridge practical space analysis theory and application" won the first prize of major scientific and technological achievements in Shanghai in 1982; "Baogang Engineering Adjustment Comprehensive Argument" won the first prize of Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Award in 1988; "Bridge Seismic Theory" was awarded In 1985, the State Education Commission won the first prize for scientific and technological progress; "the unified theory and practical calculation of the lateral distribution of various types of highway bridges" won the third prize of the State Education Commission for scientific and technological progress in 1993.</p><br>

			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Character evaluation</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Comrade Li Guohao loves the motherland and has a firm political position. As early as the 1940s, he had enjoyed a reputation in the international bridge academic community, resolutely declined the mentor's retention and returned to the motherland from Germany. On the eve of the liberation of Shanghai, he protected a group of progressive students in patriotism. During the "Cultural Revolution", despite his severe persecution, he was still concentrating on the science and education of the motherland and devoted himself to academic research. After the reform and opening up, he firmly supported the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. With great enthusiasm for work, he paid full attention to science and technology and education. Showing the noble sentiments of a party's senior cadres and senior intellectuals.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Comrade Li Guohao has broadly united all forces and actively promoted the development of the cause of the CPPCC. During his tenure as the chairman of the Sixth CPPCC in Shanghai, he earnestly implemented the Party Central Committee's united front policy and intellectual policy, and gave full play to the role of the CPPCC “talent pool” and “think tank” to contribute to the development of Shanghai's economic construction and social undertakings. With a noble scholarly style and personality, he actively promotes international science and technology, education and cultural exchanges.</p><br>
