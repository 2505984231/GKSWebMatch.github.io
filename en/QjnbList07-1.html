					<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Biography</h2>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;">●Mao Yisheng (January 9, 1896 - November 12, 1989), the word Tang Chen, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, graduated from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), Chinese civil engineering expert, bridge expert , engineering educator, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, academician of the American Academy of Engineering, academician of the Academia Sinica, has made outstanding contributions to the advancement of railway science and technology. He once presided over the construction of the first modern large-scale bridge designed and built by the Chinese, the Qiantang River Bridge. After the founding of New China, he participated in the design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. On November 12, 1989, he died in Beijing at the age of 93.</p><br>

			<div class="text">
			<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">Major achievements</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> From 1933 to 1937, Mao Yisheng was appointed as the director of the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Department, presiding over the construction of the first modern highway bridge used in China, the "Qiantang River Bridge". He used the "shooting water method", the "caisson method", the "floating method", etc., to solve one of the technical problems in the bridge construction. Since then, Mao Yisheng's footprint has spread all over the country, and his name has been left in the motherland along with the newly built bridge. After five years of hard work, Mao Yisheng finally built the modern Qiantang River Bridge. On September 26th, it was the 74th anniversary of the opening and opening of the Qiantang River Bridge.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> The Qiantang River Bridge is not only a milestone in the history of bridge construction in China, but also the cradle of bridge engineers in China. Mr. Mao Yisheng turned the construction site into a school and absorbed a large number of civil engineering students to participate in engineering practice, and trained a number of bridge engineering talents for the country. Some important bridge projects in China, such as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and some of the leaders of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, have experienced the baptism of the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> The Qiantang River Bridge shows the wisdom and wisdom of Chinese science and technology workers to the world and demonstrates the ability of the Chinese nation to stand on its own feet in the world. The great patriotism demonstrated by the pioneers of the bridge engineering industry headed by Mr. Mao Yisheng in the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, the spirit of scientific and technological innovation that dares to be the first, and the spirit of struggle that overcomes all difficulties and obstacles, is always inspiring. We are a valuable spiritual asset for the unremitting struggle of the motherland's prosperity and strength.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> From 1955 to 1957, Mao Yisheng was appointed as the chairman of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Technical Advisory Committee. He also accepted the task of building the first bridge across the Yangtze River, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. In September 1955, the bridge officially started construction and was completed on September 25, 1957, one year and three months earlier than originally planned. On October 15, 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was inaugurated. Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a double-layer steel truss bridge for railway and highway use. The upper level is a highway bridge, 22.5 meters wide, of which the roadway is 18 meters wide; the lower floor is a railway bridge, 18 meters wide. The main bridge is 1155.5 meters long, together with the approach bridges at both ends, with a total length of 1670.4 meters. The bridge connects the Jinghan Railway and the Yuehan Railway, and becomes the traffic artery that runs through the north and south of China. It combines the three towns of Wuhan to ensure the integration of the railway and road network in the north and south of China.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> When the Great Hall of the People was built in Beijing in 1958, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his review of the engineering design: "There must be Mao Yisheng's signature to guarantee." The party and state leaders have great trust in Mao Yisheng, and Mao Yisheng also has the party's The work was extremely responsible. He made a comprehensive review of the structural design of the Great Hall of the People and finally signed the name.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;">Mao Yisheng learned the bridge, built the bridge and wrote the bridge. He has published more than 200 articles in Chinese and foreign newspapers. He presided over the "Chinese Ancient Bridge Technology History" and "Chinese Bridge - Ancient Times" (with five texts: Japanese, English, French, German, Spanish). He is the author of "Qiantang River Bridge", "Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge", "Selected Works of Mao Yisheng Science Popularization" (1st and 2nd), "Mao Yisheng Collection", "Chinese Ancient Bridge and New Bridge".</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> From 1955 to 1957, Mao Yisheng was also the chairman of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Technical Advisory Committee. He also accepted the task of building the first bridge across the Yangtze River, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. In September 1955, the bridge officially started construction and was completed on September 25, 1957, two years ahead of schedule. On October 15, 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was inaugurated.</p><br>

			<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">Character evaluation</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> The famous scientist Zhou Peiyuan pointed out in the book "The Bridge Expert Mao Yisheng": "Mao Yisheng
The contribution of China's science and technology undertakings is multi-faceted. His major contributions to the cause of science popularization in China, as well as the construction of science and technology museums and science and technology newspapers, are not well known to more people.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> In the Bridge Vision, Mao Yisheng depicted various bridges. Mao Zedong once praised him: "Not only scientists but also writers.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;"> In 2006, China issued a set of four Chinese Modern Scientists (four) stamps, the second of which was Professor Mao Yisheng.</p><br>
