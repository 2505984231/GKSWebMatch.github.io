					<h2 style="font-size: 18px;">Biography</h2>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;font-size: 16px;">●Li Guohao (1913.04.13~2005.02.23), male, Meixian County, Guangdong Province. Outstanding party members of the Communist Party of China, famous bridge engineering and mechanics experts, educators, social activists, members of the NLD, member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Sixth Committee of the Shanghai People's Political Consultative Conference, Party Secretary Former President, Honorary President and Professor of Tongji University, Representative of the 3rd and 5th National People's Congress, 4th and 5th Chairman of China Civil Engineering Society, 6th, 7th and 8th Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chairman of the China Society of Bridges and Structural Engineering, the first chairman of the China Society of Engineering Society, former vice chairman of the Chinese Society of Mechanics, the first chairman of the Shanghai Institute of Mechanics, and the former chairman of the Shanghai Association for Science and Technology was elected the world's top ten in 1981. A famous structural engineer, in 1987 won the International Bridge and Structural Engineering Association Merit Award. In 1995 and 1996, he won the Heliang Heli Science and Technology Progress Award and the Chen Jiageng Technology Science Award.</p><br>

			<div class="text">
			<h3 style="line-height: 50px;">Historical life</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Li Guohao was born in Meixian, Guangdong, the "hometown of football" in China. He likes sports since he was a child, and he is also eager to study. In middle school, he prefers math and foreign languages. He has a characteristic that he never dies his textbooks and likes to think independently. Reading a book the same, his attention is different from others. For example, "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms", people only see the siege to win the pool, the sword and the sword, but he is pondering the "wooden cows" invented by Zhuge Liang - really strange, for the organs to start, they can be transported away like flying?</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> When Li Guohao was a youth, he had a pair of fantasy wings. He worshipped Euclidean and Newton, and later wanted to be a great inventor like Edison. However, what he admires most is the ancient Chinese monk. He had decided to be a water conservancy engineer and to control the rushing Yellow River.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;">In 1938, the young man from Meixian, Guangdong, received the German Humboldt Scholarship. Going to Darmstadt University of Technology for further study and being approved for direct Ph.D., studying under the famous structural mechanics and steel structure scientist Kreiber. In the second year, the war began, and that period made him unforgettable. He recalled that rich classmates went to Switzerland and France. He had no money and could only stay. Soon, the British and American declared war on Germany, and the students went to work as soldiers. He also stayed in the teaching and research section of Kreiber for research work until 1945, when the war ended. In the meantime, in 1941, the Wang Puppet regime established an "embassy" in Germany. He did not contact them. The passport expired and was sent to Switzerland. At that time, they had more than 100 people, and they had a taste of "Yishan Yi".</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In 1940, Li Guohao received his Ph.D. in engineering with the excellent paper "The Practical Calculation Method of the Suspension Bridge According to the Second Order Theory". After the publication of the "Steel Structure" magazine, the bridge engineering community caused great repercussions. Li Guohao, who was only 26 years old, was known as the "suspension bridge Li" since then. Since then, in addition to his research on the welding of steel structures, he is mainly responsible for studying the new and old problems in various bridge structures that appear in engineering practice. He is interested in the analysis of suspension bridges, row bridges and structural stability, and has achieved creative results from one to one, and published nearly ten important papers. Among them, in the process of in-depth study on the suspension bridge proposed by Hamburg, he revealed the advantage of the unsupported bending moment peak of the system of three-span continuous stiffening beam without intermediate support. After thirty years, this system is finally at 70. It was successfully adopted in a cable-stayed bridge project built in the United States. As for his superb analysis of the dynamic effect of the train on the suspension bridge, its analysis methods and analysis results filled the gap at that time. In 1942, the young Chinese scholar participated in the revision of the German steel structure stability norm presided over by Krebler and Hewala. The "Development of the Elastic Balanced Branch" was proposed by him. A basic criterion for stability. Soon, this energetic and energetic young man became the first Chinese student to receive a German Dr.-lng.habil degree with the paper "Geometry Method of Steel Structure Analysis". In the summer of 1943, he successfully published the paper "New Methods for Structural Analysis of Trusses and Similar Systems." The innovative thinking patterns embodied in the paper were later widely cited in the calculation of high-rise buildings and other complex structures. In September 1944, Li Guohao moved to the city of Wittsburg. At this point, his period of working with Krebler has basically come to an end. In the winter of 1944, Li Guohao and Dr. Ye Jingen, a doctor working at the University of Würzburg, became beautiful. Recalling the past, Li Guohao still seems to be affectionate. He said that during that time, everything was scarce. Only the emotional life made the gray around it colorful and lively. He often rode his bicycle to visit his fiancée in Witzburg, 150 km away.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> After the end of World War II, Li Guohao, who had moved to southern Germany, and his wife, took a section of the US military, and went to Paris in a dusty way. Two days later, he went to Marseille and lived in a shelter. It was in the winter that they went to the woods to pick up the branches to make fire, and to lay a blanket on the floor, it was a temporary home, but fortunately there was red wine, one cup per person per day. The taste of the wine is never forgotten. Another unforgettable thing is that he and his wife Ye Jingen have ushered in a new life in their world, their eldest son Li Guihua! Returning to China means returning to China, and returning to China has brought good luck to the whole family! A few months later, they finally boarded a boat from France to Vietnam and went to Saigon, which was in March 1946. In Saigon, the consulate hosted the room and board. He remembered it and the food was very bad. The only thing to be thankful for is that it is a step closer to the motherland, and his greatest wish at the time was to return to the motherland. Soon, Li Guohao took Ye Jingen, took his return to China, and embarked on his return journey from Saigon to the motherland.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, Li Guohao was escaping and was imprisoned in the isolation room on unwarranted charges. He spent two years in the long cell. He learned from the radio that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was open to traffic. He remembered the Wujiang Yangtze River Bridge. . Because in the opening ceremony of that year, the bridge appeared to sway, and the reason for the shaking did not always have a convincing scientific explanation. He is very clear that it will naturally affect the later Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, affecting the design of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge! Thus, a touching story began to be interpreted in a few squares of the cell, a scientist who lost his freedom, empty-handed, without a piece of paper, with a love for the motherland for his career, with a superior theoretical foundation and creation. Thinking, the gods swim in the eight poles, and the composition is in the Daqian. With the help of the corners and cracks of the newspapers, deductive deductions, no me, nothing, and the past, a new path! He squinted his eyes and sat on the ground for eight thousand miles; he fixed his eyes and looked at the mustard. For a time, the hundred ideas were coming, so I went to the rough and refined, and went to the falsehood. He suddenly became cheerful and he was delighted. Therefore, the web of the bridge of the 桁 bridge is transformed into a shear plate; further, the space is discretely systemized into a continuum box girder model, and the elastic equilibrium differential equations of bending and torsion are established to solve! If you see big music, you will be happy. In the autumn to winter, in the alternating heat and cold, Li Guohao, the "prisoner" of the Cultural Revolution, finally took the painstaking effort and achieved the initial analysis of the theoretical analysis of the field of truss structure.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> After that, he walked out of the cell and was driven to the school to supervise labor. When will the suffering years come to an end? He can't know. But he clearly realized that the world must always move forward. Human society must always be prosperous and developed. The bridge engineering industry must always develop and develop. In this regard, he firmly believes. As always, he turned his home into a research room, started a bridge model and reversed the experiment, and continued to improve the theoretical analysis and computational steps. For a person who is dedicated to love and dedicated to science, once he invests, what can he do?</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In 1973, Li Guohao finally completed his work and completed the monograph in the cell years, "Twisted beam torsion theory - the twisting, stability and vibration of the bridge." The wall is broken and the truth is available. Since then, the vibration problem of the Wuhan Bridge and the doubts about the stability of the Nanjing Bridge have finally been solved in the past, and thus eliminated the block heart disease of the Chinese Bridge design for many years, and opened up the theoretical analysis of the truss structure. The master of a generation, Li Guohao, has a hard time, and he has benefited all the people and benefited the world.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In 1979, Li Guohao was appointed as the chairman of the Shanghai Association for Science and Technology and the chief consultant of the Baosteel Advisory Committee. In 1980, people in Beijing rumored that Baosteel would be dismounted. The following year, it was said that the national economy had to be adjusted. Some people proposed to let Baosteel dismount. This time it seems that it is really moving, because the working group has arrived at the scene, and it is more certain that the aftermath has been discussed. The Baosteel Advisory Committee stated its position. This is a big event, and it is on the skin of life and death. As the chief consultant, Li Guohao first spoke. At the meeting, many eyes eagerly stared at him. For this highly respected predecessor, many of his peers and experts have always been the only ones.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> One word and one sentence, Li Guohao said six words: "Baoste can not dismount!" Then, his reasons, his statement, his analysis, like his Meixian Mandarin, is tough and convincing.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> At that time, the annual output of steel in the country was 36 million tons. No. At least 100 million tons, one billion! The topic turned to Baosteel. As far as Li Zhenhao is concerned, Li Guohao said that the investment in the first phase of construction is more than 80 billion. After the dismissal, the original equipment will be preserved, the land will be built, and the warehouse will be built. This will cost money, and the already ordered goods cannot be returned. If you want to spend money, if Baosteel dismounts, more than 80 billion yuan plus a few hundred million will be paid. However, if you add another 12 billion, you will be able to form productivity immediately!</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> There are facts, analysis, and orderly words and sentences. He said categorically: "So, this account should not be counted from zero, but from 80 billion!" The words are both out, the stone is shocked, full of surprises, layers of waves. A good one should not count from zero! It is related to reform and opening up, it is related to the overall situation, and it is related to the future. He feels that the words are still in the air, and he wants to spit. Can't dismount, it's a good idea not to dismount! Not only can you not dismount in the first phase, nor in the second phase. The first phase of production of steel billets, the second phase of production of steel plates, this is to make money! This well-thought-out rumor, lyrics, deeply touched the hearts of every participant.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Li Guohao’s speech at the meeting shocked the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and alerted the State Council. Finally, the central leadership stated: Li Guohao’s opinion is justified. Decided to adopt it. At that time, Baosteel had a senior engineer. The family was afraid that he would say the wrong words at that meeting and let him be a rightist. He repeatedly told him not to speak. When Li Guohao spoke, he looked very nervous. He never imagined that after Li Guohao’s speech, not only was he not labeled as a rightist, but his opinions were also heard by the central leadership and finally adopted!</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In accordance with the central government's deployment and the needs of Shanghai's economic and social development, Shanghai will be built as an important international shipping center in the world. To achieve this goal, no quality deep-water port is impossible. In this regard, the Shanghai leadership and relevant departments, based on years of consideration and research, determined the size of Yangshan as the object, formed an expert group, and asked Li Guohao to be the team leader, responsible for the site selection and demonstration of the deep water port. After a lot of investigation and research and many expert arguments, the feasibility study was successfully completed. However, due to various reasons, Shanghai’s plan to build an international deep-water port has been stranded. In September and October 1999, Li Guohao wrote to Comrade Jiang Zemin twice, in which he fully expressed his opinion that he must build a deep-water port in Shanghai as soon as possible. On October 20, 2000, at the ceremony of Zhenjiang Yangtze River Bridge (Note: Runyang Yangtze River Bridge), Li Guohao met with President Jiang Zemin and further explained the feasibility and urgency of building Shanghai International Deepwater Port. After returning to Beijing, President Jiang Zemin soon convened the leadership of the State Economic Commission to understand the situation and made four points in the letter of Li Guohao. He emphasized that the construction of the Shanghai International Deepwater Port is "very significant" and requires "all relevant parties in the country to take care of the overall situation and work together to build it is good". With the care and support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the construction of the Dahe Xiaoyangshan Deepwater Port Project officially started.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In the memory of Tongji teachers and students, Li Guohao has been diligent and eager to learn all his life. He never forgets to study, live to the old age, and learn to be old. In the 1990s, he was already in his 80s. He began to learn computer, learn Chinese Pinyin, stroke input method, etc. He met people who mastered computer knowledge and skills. He was humbly asking for shameless questions, and later sent E-mail and wrote with a computer. Articles, etc., he has learned.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> When Li Guohao was nearly 90 years old, he also bought a variety of foreign documents, such as French 300 sentences, Spanish, German, etc., learning foreign languages to increase knowledge. Once I received a French foreign guest, he gave a welcome speech in French. The French friend was very happy and immediately had a sense of closeness and a harmonious atmosphere. In addition to studying, Li Guohao reads newspapers every day, listens to radio, watches news broadcasts, and cares about major events at home and abroad. The news often reports that earthquakes, tsunami, floods, and volcanic eruptions occurred in certain countries and regions; railways, tunnels, and bridges were built in certain areas. ... He will immediately check the map of the world or the map of China, confirm the area, location, and make it clear and clear.</p><br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> After 1987, he served as the advisory team leader of Shanghai Nanpu Bridge, the consultant of Shanghai Yangpu Bridge, the head of the advisory team of Shantou Bay Bridge, the head of the advisory team of Humen Pearl River Bridge, the chief consultant of Guangdong Lingyang Bridge Engineering Advisory Committee, and the Shanghai-Chongming Highway Cross-river Channel. The leader of the expert group of the programme selection meeting. In 1994, he was elected as the first academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. From 1996 to 2002, he served as the team leader of the pre-assessment meeting of the Yangshan Deepwater Port Project of Shanghai International Shipping Center. In 2000, 14 academicians enthusiastically wrote letters to the central leadership and proposed to speed up the construction of Yangshan Deepwater Port. In 2002, he served as honorary advisor to the East China Sea Bridge.</p><br>
